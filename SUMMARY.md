**STN PLAD: A Dataset for Multi-Size Power Line Assets Detection in High-Resolution UAV Images** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 133 images with 2409 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *tower*, *damper*, *insulator*, and other: *spacer* and *plate*.

Each image in the STN PLAD dataset has bounding boxes annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (133 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [Sistema de Transmiss√£o do Nordeste S.A., Brazil](https://stnordeste.com.br/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
